## Risk Factors for Fetal Deaths by Gestational Age in 2020
This project attempts to explore the relationship between five risk factors (sex, race, birthplace, motherâ€™s education and cigarette usage) and the gestational age. This file mainly investigates the race variable. Data extraction, visualization, ANOVA test and linear regression are performed to achieve our goal.

## Code and Documentation
The code is executed under Python 1.7.2. The following packages are implemented in the code: CSV, DataFrames, GLM, HypothesisTests, MLJ, PlotlyJS.

[ygao98_race_extract.jl](https://github.com/methods2022/team10/blob/master/ygao98_race_extract.jl) extracts the gestational age, race (6 categories) and detailed race (single-race and multiracial values with 31 categories), and saves the data into a CSV file.

[ygao98_race_analysis.jl](https://github.com/methods2022/team10/blob/master/ygao98_race_analysis.jl) uses the groupby function to the dataframe and tabulate the race variable to get the distribution.

[ygao98_race_visual.jl](https://github.com/methods2022/team10/blob/master/ygao98_race_visual.jl) makes three plots: two boxplots of gestational age by race and by detailed race, as well as the histogram of the gestational age. The plots are saved in the [fig](https://github.com/methods2022/team10/tree/master/fig) folder.

[ygao98_race_stats.jl](https://github.com/methods2022/team10/blob/master/ygao98_race_stats.jl) creates subsets for the race column, gets the description of the subsets, performs ANOVA tests and trains an univariate linear regression model.

[combined_data.jl](https://github.com/methods2022/team10/blob/master/combined_data.jl) combines all the risk factors together to see the discription for the overall dataset.
