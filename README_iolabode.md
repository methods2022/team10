Risk Factors for Fetal Deaths by Gestational Age in 2020

The project intends to investigate when (gestational age of death) sex of a fetus is a risk for intrauterine death. 
It uses 2020 data from the CDC's NVSS dataset and uses ANOVA and linear regression to analyze the data. 

The project is beginner friendly and uses Julia and a downloaded text file from CDC's NVSS. 

Most useful/noteworthy for data cleaning/tabulation and statistical analyses.

It seeks to find out at what gestational age does sex of a fetus becaome a risk factor for intrauterine death and 
visualizes the results in a boxplot. It finds that males experience intrauterine death younger than females and the 
death occurs around 26-27 weeks of gestation. 

Key concepts are ANOVA, linear regression, boxplots, pregnancy risk factors

Study completed in Spring 2022 

Core Technical Concepts are dictionaries, filter(), describe(), ANOVA, linear regression, boxplots

The research exists because understanding when the sex of the fetus affects fetal death and at what gestational age 
can inform healthcare providers, and expecting parents/families how to more effectively direct intervention with 
appropriate timing.

This work compares to other projects as much of biomedical informatics on the topic of fetal sex as a risk factors 
look at the magnitue at which fetal sex affects intrauterine death. However, this research identifies when (gestational 
age /week of death) fetal sex is a risk factor for intrauterine death. 

Technical Concepts are dictionaries, filter(), describe(), ANOVA, linear regression, boxplots

Boxplot Summary Statistics, ANOVA and linear regression require downloading these packages: CSV, DataFrames, GLM, Plots, PlotlyJS, HypothesisTests, MLJ
