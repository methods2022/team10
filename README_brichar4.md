## Risk Factors for Fetal Death by Gestational Age in 2020

The term fetal death refers to the spontaneous intrauterine death of a fetus during the course of a woman’s pregnancy. While clinical, obstetrical, and biological history has been at the forefront of the discussion surrounding predicting fetal death, the exploration of certain sociodemographic features adds significant insight to current efforts in preventative care. Previous studies focused on finding associations with fetal death on a global scale and thus took into account the unique characteristics of countries from around the world. By running [ANOVA](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/one-way-anova-statistical-guide.php) and uni- and multivariate [linear regression](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/linreg.htm) in Julia, this study aimed to investigate the associations of sex, race, birthplace, and mother’s education and cigarette usage with fetal death and gestational age at fetal death in a solely American population. Patient cases were identified using the publicly available [2020 Vital Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm) data from the CDC.

Installation of Julia [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and/or basic knowledge of running Julia programs in terminal is highly recommended.
